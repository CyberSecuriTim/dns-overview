<h1>DNS for Dumm...DNS Done Simply üòÖ</h1> <br />

<p>

  - This tutorial outlines the basic domain name to IP address resolution process which is a vital component of the Domain Name System which allows us to visit all our favourite websites 
    and "seamlessly" (most of the time anyways) traverse the internet daily.

  - Before we dive into the practical lab exercise I would just like to give you a brief summary of how DNS works and why it is important (to all my fellow IT nerds who already know how 
     DNS works feel free to skip ahead) ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    - It is much easier for us as humans to remember domain names such as (google.com, facebook.com, youtube.com etc) than it is to memorize an arbitrary sequence of numbers that forms 
      the IP addresses for each of those websites.
       - Imagine having to type XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX everytime you wanted to visit your favourite website...(I shiver at the thought).
     
    - However, our computers and other networked/networking devices are much more proficient at interacting with those arbitrary sequence of numbers known as IP addresses.
    - Behind the scenes, this wonderful technology (DNS) bridges the gap and allows both entities (humans and computers) to communicate with each other harmoniously.
      - It will convert the domain names that you enter into the address bar of your favourite web browser into IP addresses that computers and servers (and the other devices in 
        underlying internet infrastructure understand) so your network traffic can be appropriately routed.
      - This process also occurs in the reverse (known as a reverse DNS lookup) in which an IP address is converted to a domain name but for the sake of simplicity and focusing on more 
        everyday use we will only focus on the forward DNS lookups (domain names to IP addresses).
